title: BRAT v3X Outputs
---

The majority of users of BRAT will not actually run BRAT themselves, but instead will download BRAT outputs and interact with them. In the text and videos tutorials below, we walk you through various ways to interact with the outputs of BRAT. We cover topics in order from simplest to most complex. 

## The BRAT Default Legends

### Capacity Layer
The **capacity model** outputs use the following color scheme to bin the output data (note each â‰¤300 m reach has a specific continuous dam density output). Existing capacity output is found in the `OCC_EX` field and historic capacity is found in the `oCC_HPE` field.

   ![Legend_BRAT_DamDensity_WIDE]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Capacity_BRATv3X.png){: width="300" height="300"}

In addition, the capacity outputs and reach lengths were used to report estimated dam complex size `mCC_EX_CT` (for existing) and `mCC_HPE_CT` (for historic) fields:

### Preliminary Management Layers
The **preliminary management** output layers include outputs that describe the limiting factors which contribute to unsuitable or limited beaver dam opportunities (`oPBC_UD`), risk categories which are based on land use and anthropogenic proximity (`oPBC_UI`), and finally a measure of the effort exhibited to perform restoration or conservation in the segment (`oPCRC_CR`).  For the (`oPCRC_CR`) output a sub-set of the segments classified as 'Negligible Risk' and 'Minor Risk' (`oPBC_UI`) is used to focus restoration or conservation efforts. Segments that are 'Considerable Risk' or 'Some Risk' (`oPCRC_UI`) are defined as 'Other' for (`oPCRC_CR`) field. Further documentation and discussion/development of these layers can be found [here](https://github.com/Riverscapes/pyBRAT/issues/207). The following color schemes were used to define the management fields:

- Unsuitable or Limited Beaver Dam Opportunities (`oPBRC_UD`) uses the following color scheme:

- Areas Beavers Can Build Dams, but Could Be Undesirable (`oPBRC_UI`) uses the following color scheme:

  ![Legend BRAT Management Areas Beavers Can Build Dams, but Could Be Undesirable]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Anthropogenic_Risk.png){: width="300" height="300"}

- Restoration or Conservation Opportunities (`oPCRC_CR`) uses the following color scheme:

## Attribute Field Descriptions

What do all those attribute fields correspond to?  Below is a table describing all of the outputs that appear in the BRAT KMZs and feature class attribute tables (i.e. shapefiles and LayerPackages). Source table can be found [here](https://usu.box.com/s/ekjw3e2iuxafpj0ttl0uzdyh9ifydmtl) for closer inspection.

## Visualizing BRAT Outputs

### Web GIS Portal on DataBasin

If you are not a GIS user and you either don't have or don't want to install [Google Earth Desktop](https://www.google.com/earth/), you can visualize the results in an interactive [WebGIS Browser on DataBasin](http://databasin.org/datasets/1420ffb7e9674753a5fb626e2b830c1f) (currently only for Utah).

### Google Earth

If you want to browse around the BRAT outputs in [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/), you can download KMZ files [from our data repository](http://brat.joewheaton.org/BRATData) and virtually fly away.

### ArcGIS

If you have access to ArcGIS and are [comfortable getting around](http://gis.joewheaton.org/) in ArcGIS, this video shows you how to download the shapefiles and layer files and visualize them in ArcGIS.

Looking further into working with BRAT layer packages for interrogation and visualization.

## Queries in ArcGIS

If you want to interrogate the BRAT results and run queries to summarize them in more useful ways for your areas of interest, this video shows you how (warning > 20 minutes).
