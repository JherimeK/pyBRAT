Tutorials of [Running pyBRAT]() from start to finish has been provided to help BRAT users with a detailed description of the inputs and the intermediate steps needed to run the BRAT tool successfully. 

In addition there are instructions for general [ungulate]() analysis for those that would like to apply similar proximity and probability analysis with other species besides beaver. This is a general layout of inputs and tools that will be used for this. It is not a comprehensive or literary reviewed process like what has been done with [pyBRAT](http://brat.riverscapes.xyz/Documentation/references.html). Improved analysis should be sought out considering ungulates that has been done by other scientists and biologists.
